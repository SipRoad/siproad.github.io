   <h1>Step #1: Don't be a child</h1>
     <p>Vaping isn't good for you kid. Don't do it. Wait until everyone agrees you're ready to screw up your own life before doing the vapes.</p>

     <p>If you're under 21 years of age, click <a href="https://youtu.be/BdBV-Cy9fNg">this link</a> and never come back. Then burn your computer in a bonfire just to make sure no remnants of this forbidden information will ever tempt you again.</p>
     <p>Ok we're all adults here now, right? Good. Keep reading.</p>
   <h1>Step #2: Follow the law</h1>
     <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/26Ff8BjNLejt679zq" width="480" height="360" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>
     <p>It's your civic duty not to inhale, ingest, or otherwise put anything into your body unless a majority of people who live nearby give you permission. Don't even think about making those kinds of decisions yourself because you cannot be trusted with that kind of power, degenerate scum that you are.</p>
     <p>Do your own research and don't follow these instructions if they are illegal where you live. You should also consider burning your computer too. If you're an apartment dweller, microwaving it will also work.</p>
   <h1>Step #3: Buy Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrency)</h1>
     <p>You'll need some crypto to buy vape juice privately. Bitcoin is the most popular and I recommend you buy that.</p>
       <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/OS8mPktWKwacg" width="480" height="434" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>
     <p>Why do you need crypto? Because you're using a marketplace built for privacy and you can't use a credit card or PayPal or Venmo. Buckle up brothers and sisters because you're not buying artisinal cheese boards from Etsy.
     <p>You'll need a wallet to hold your Bitcoin. You can find easy to use wallets on iOS and Android if you're dealing with small amounts of crypto (no more than a few hundred dollars). Search around in the app stores. Don't use Coinbase.</p>
     <p>How do you get crypto? Find a nerd friend and ask them if they have any, and if they don't, then find a better nerd friend. Try your hardest to buy from someone in person; it's more private that way. You can buy from an exchange like Coinbase, but they require using your identity and the judges deduct lots of points for that.</p>
     <p>You can use <a href="https://hodlhodl.com/">HodlHodl</a> or <a href="https://bisq.network/">Bisq</a> if you literally don't know a single person in 2019 who decided to get rich quick on the crypto bubble and then lost money but still is weirdly confident that Bitcoin will go "To the Moon" and so they're "HODLing" and eating a lot of meat while they wait for retirement.</p>
   <h1>Step #4: Download and Use OpenBazaar</h1>
     <p>This is the part where we go all futuristic and everything turns into light beams streaming past your soon-to-be-filled-with-vape-juice starship.</p>
       <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/x1VqwmsrSlYA0" width="480" height="360" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>
     <p>Download and run <a href="https://openbazaar.org/">OpenBazaar.</a> It's a marketplace, but instead of being run by Amazon or other mega-corporations, it's actually a peer to peer network where people connect directly to each others computers. That means there's no one in the middle to stop the trade from happening, or take a cut, or even see what's happening. When you use OpenBazaar, you aren't asking for permission to trade, you're just doing it.</p>
     <p>It's easy to use but you can follow <a href="https://youtu.be/VzlerMJMOu8">this tutorial</a> if you need help. For extra bonus privacy points, you can also run OpenBazaar over Tor as described in this video.</p>

   <h1>Step #5: Add new search providers</h1>
     <p>To see everything OpenBazaar has to offer you need to add some new search providers. It sounds complicated but it takes 15 seconds. If you can copy and paste a link then you can do this. And if you can't, how the hell did you even make it this far?</p>
    <p>Follow the instructions <a href="https://searchbizarre.com/about">here</a> or <a href="https://bazaar.blockstamp.market/">here</a> and you're done. You can then click on those search providers and search for more listings.</p>
   <h1>Step #6: Search for vape juice</h1>
     <p>You know how to search for things. You've been practicing for this your whole life, unless you're older than about 35, in which case you've been practicing for this for some indeterminate fraction of your life. Search for things now.</p>
   <h1>Step #7: Buy the vape juice</h1>
     <p>When you find what you want, buy it. Make sure to use "moderated purchase" and not "direct purchase." Direct purchase means there's no escrow and those shady vendors can just steal your hard earned coins. With moderated purchase you get escrow. Nice.</p>
   <h1>Step #8: There is no step 8</h1>
     <p>You already bought vape juice privately, what more do you want from me?</p>
     <p>Nope I ain't doing that, sorry.</p>

       <p>My contact information is non-existent since I don't really want to interact with you degenerates. I sometimes tweet under the handle <a href="https://twitter.com/SipRoad">@SipRoad</a>.
